- [Fuchsia documentation ](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts).
	Starting point help: We want to focus on the *kernel*'s abstractions.
	You can find the documentation for the kernel on this page as well.
	You can start by understanding what calls are blocking, and which are non-blocking, then move on to how the zircon notion of *signalling* is tied to events.
- Some of the [conventions](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/api/system) make digesting the documentation easier.
